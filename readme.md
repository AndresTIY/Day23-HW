-
#### Part 3
Requirements
- Create a "Blog Reading App"
- Must have 2 columns
  - Left Column has links to different blog posts
  - Right Column contains Blog Title and Body
  - WHEN: Blog on left is clicked
  - WHAT: Blog is displayed on right

- start with creating two divs side by side
  - everything in body is centered already
  - have left column be smaller than right
- Questions so far:
  - In order to get links, I need to get the url ID
  - How do I retrieve the link? Must put it in an anchor tag. Perhaps as a list element.
  - GET LINKS/ID BEFORE I LEAVE TODAY

c) Create a "blog reading app", where you have two columns. A list of blog posts on the side and a place to read the posts in the middle. When you click on a post title, it "opens" that post by placing its contents in the middle column, but does not remove the list from the page.
